0.5.0 (Unreleased)
==================
Features:
* Structure Matching
    * Allows for matching a syllable based upon its segments
    * Easy insertion of whole syllables
* Syllables can now be substituted in the place of a segment

Fixes:
* Modifying a syllable `%` with secondary stress is no longer a syntax error 🙃🙃🙃
* Insertion between segments propagates properly after a previous "no match"
* Inserting before a syllable boundary where a pre-environment is specified now works as expected
    * Previously, `* > ? / V_$C` would not work as expected, while `* > ? / _$C` would
* Applying a negative feature to a node that is not present does not attach the node
    * For example, assigning `[-round]` to `/t/` would make it `[+lab, -ldental, -rnd]` when it should have no effect.
